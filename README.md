# aws-quicksight-slackanalytics-app

This repo contains two main components: 
- A custom Athena Federated Query (AFQ) connector to query data from the Slack Member Analytics REST API endpoint using SQL, and 
- A sample web application to perform OAuth with the Slack Web API and securely store the bearer token in an AWS Secrets Manager secret. 

Supporting AWS CloudFormation templates are available to deploy each of these components. 

Note: The sample web application is only required during the OAuth workflow. For cost control recommend terminating your AWS CloudFormation 
Stack once the Slack App is authorized with your Slack Enterprise Grid.  If you redeploy the template you will need to update your redirect endpoint from Slack.com. In future releases we plan to make this workflow serverless.

## Deploy the Slack Web Application and AFQ Connector

1. Register a new and custom Slack App following [these instructions](https://api.slack.com/scopes/admin.analytics:read)

Note: In the OAuth and Permissions section, you'll need to specify a redirect URL. Use a placeholder such as "https://not-a-real-domain.com/" to save and obtain the credentials. You will update this redirect URL at a later step. 

2. Create an AWS Secrets Manager secret named "slackanalytics_app_secret" and store your Slack app's client secrets under the  "client_id" and "client_secret" keys.

3. Deploy the sample Slack Web App in your AWS account using this AWS CloudFormation template.   

    - From the AWS Console:  [Template](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?&templateURL=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/quicksight.slackanalytics.afqconnector/sample_slack_app_template.yaml&stackName=qs-slackanalytics-web-app)
    
    - From terminal (replace all elements within "< >":

```
    aws cloudformation create-stack \
        --stack-name <choose_a_unique_name> \
        --template-body file://cloudformation/sample_slack_app_template.yaml \
        --parameters ParameterKey=AppVPC,ParameterValue=<your_vpc_id>\
            ParameterKey=AppSubnets,ParameterValue="<your_subnet_1>\\,<your_subnet_2>" \
            ParameterKey=InstanceKeyPair,ParameterValue=<your_ssh_key_pair> \
        --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Note: current template is supported for the us-east-1 region only and requires a subnet with public internet access to download source from git repo.  You can customize the /cloudformation/sample_slack_app_template.yaml file if you need to deploy with a different configuration. 
        
4. Follow the instructions described in the web app UI to update your redirect URL, authenticate and install the custom AFQ function in your AWS account.

Note: After authentication your AWS Secrets Manager secret should contain new key:value pairs with your authentication info.

5. Use the AWS Cloudformation link from the Successfull Authentication UI to deploy your custom AFQ connector in your account.

6. Register your new AWS Lambda function as an [Athena Data Source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-to-a-data-source-lambda.html).

7. Query the Slack Member Analytics using Amazon Athena or QuickSight Connector to Athena.
